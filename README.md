# Build-the-Game-of-Life

This is one of my projects in the way to achieve "Legacy Data Visualization" certification at freeCodeCamp.org. It was designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, populated and unpopulated. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: When I first arrive at the game, it will randomly generate a board and start playing.

User Story: I can start and stop the board.

User Story: I can set up the board.

User Story: I can clear the board.

User Story: When I press start, the game will play out.

User Story: Each time the board changes, I can see how many generations have gone by.
